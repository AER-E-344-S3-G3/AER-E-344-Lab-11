\acrfull{piv} is a technique that entails tracking the particles within the flow of fluid around an airfoil to map a flow field. This experiment makes use of an airfoil in a wind tunnel, a laser illuminating the particles, and a high speed camera that captures the motion of the particles. By analyzing consecutive images from the camera, we are able to determine velocity vectors. Doing this repeatedly, we can obtain a velocity field. This process enables the measurements of wake characteristics, which can be compared to the results from previous experiments, such as results from the Pitot rake and hotwire experiments.
